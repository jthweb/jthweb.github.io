# JThweb's Profile Website

---

ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome to My Portfolio!**

Hello! I'm **JThweb**, a passionate high school student with a keen interest in technology and programming. I love to tinker with tech and create innovative projects.

## ðŸ’» GitHub Integration

This website features a unique GitHub OAuth application I developed, called **JThweb-Bot**. This application streamlines the process of engaging with my GitHub profile. When you click to star or follow me on GitHub, the bot performs these actions directly from this website. This means you can support my work without being redirected to my GitHub page, making the experience seamless and user-friendly.

The integration is designed to enhance user interaction and simplify the process of connecting with my projects. If you're interested in implementing similar functionality for your own projects, Iâ€™d be happy to help!
