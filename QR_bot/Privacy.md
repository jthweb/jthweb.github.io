Last updated: 2025-10-01

This Privacy Policy explains what data the Qatar Airways Virtual Discord Bot (the "Bot") stores and how it is used. By using the Bot, you agree to this policy.

> Note: This is a fan-operated/community bot for the Qatar Airways Virtual server. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Qatar Airways.

1. Data We Store
- User balances (Avios): to operate the bot’s economy features.
- Shop configuration and redemptions: items, prices, role IDs, and purchase actions to fulfill rewards.
- Tickets: channel IDs and limited metadata (owner ID, subject) needed to manage support tickets.
- Invite counts: the number of invites credited to a user to support invite leaderboards/logging.
- Daily/work/crime/rob cooldowns and timestamps: to enforce fair usage.

2. Data We Do NOT Store
- We do not store message content beyond what’s needed for a specific command or immediate action.
- We do not store Discord tokens, passwords, or sensitive authentication data from users.

3. Where Data Is Stored
- Data is stored as JSON files on the host running the Bot (e.g., balances.json, shop.json, invites.json, etc.).
- Data persists until deleted by server administrators or the host operator.

4. How We Use the Data
- To provide features such as balances, payouts, shop purchases, ticketing, and invite tracking.
- To prevent abuse and enforce cooldowns.

5. Sharing and Third Parties
- The Bot does not sell or share your data with third parties. Data may be visible to server administrators with file access on the host machine.

6. Retention and Deletion
- Data is kept as long as the Bot operates in the server. Admins may request deletion of specific data (e.g., reset a user’s balance) using admin commands or by removing the files.

7. Security
- Files are stored locally. The security of these files depends on the security of the host machine and its filesystem permissions.

8. Children’s Privacy
- The Bot is intended for use on Discord and is subject to Discord’s age requirements. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the minimum age allowed by Discord.

9. Changes to This Policy

# Terms of Service (ToS) for the Qatar Airways Virtual Discord Bot

Last updated: 2025-10-01

By using the Qatar Airways Virtual Discord Bot (the "Bot"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

> Note: This is a fan-operated/community bot for the Qatar Airways Virtual server. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Qatar Airways.

1. Access and Eligibility
- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
- Server administrators determine who may use the Bot in their server.

2. Features and Economy
- The Bot provides utility features (booking, tickets, information) and an in-server virtual currency economy ("Avios").
- Avios have no real-world value. They are not redeemable for money, goods, or services outside the server context.
- Shop items may include roles or cosmetic perks. Granting a role requires the Bot to have the necessary permissions and role hierarchy.

3. Shop and Purchases
- Prices and items are configured by server admins and may change at any time.
- All purchases are final within the context of the server. Admins may, at their discretion, reverse or adjust a purchase in the event of error or abuse.
- The Bot attempts to fulfill purchases automatically (e.g., grant roles). If fulfillment fails, the Bot will refund the Avios where possible.

4. User Content and Conduct
- Do not use the Bot for illegal, harmful, harassing, or abusive behavior.
- Do not attempt to exploit bugs, abuse the economy, or circumvent cooldowns/permissions.
- The Bot may disable or limit features for users who violate server rules or these ToS.

5. Availability and Changes
- The Bot is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Features may change, break, or be removed without notice.
- We may update these ToS at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated ToS.

6. Data and Privacy
- See the Privacy Policy for how we handle data. The Bot keeps minimal data necessary to operate features (e.g., balances, tickets, invites).

7. Liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Bot maintainers are not liable for any damages arising from use of the Bot.

8. Contact
- For questions or issues, contact a server administrator or open a ticket using the Bot’s /ticket command.
