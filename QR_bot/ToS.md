# Terms of Service (ToS) for the Qatar Airways Virtual Discord Bot

Last updated: 2025-10-01

By using the Qatar Airways Virtual Discord Bot (the "Bot"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

> Note: This is a fan-operated/community bot for the Qatar Airways Virtual server. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Qatar Airways.

1. Access and Eligibility
- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
- Server administrators determine who may use the Bot in their server.

2. Features and Economy
- The Bot provides utility features (booking, tickets, information) and an in-server virtual currency economy ("Avios").
- Avios have no real-world value. They are not redeemable for money, goods, or services outside the server context.
- Shop items may include roles or cosmetic perks. Granting a role requires the Bot to have the necessary permissions and role hierarchy.

3. Shop and Purchases
- Prices and items are configured by server admins and may change at any time.
- All purchases are final within the context of the server. Admins may, at their discretion, reverse or adjust a purchase in the event of error or abuse.
- The Bot attempts to fulfill purchases automatically (e.g., grant roles). If fulfillment fails, the Bot will refund the Avios where possible.

4. User Content and Conduct
- Do not use the Bot for illegal, harmful, harassing, or abusive behavior.
- Do not attempt to exploit bugs, abuse the economy, or circumvent cooldowns/permissions.
- The Bot may disable or limit features for users who violate server rules or these ToS.

5. Availability and Changes
- The Bot is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Features may change, break, or be removed without notice.
- We may update these ToS at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated ToS.

6. Data and Privacy
- See the Privacy Policy for how we handle data. The Bot keeps minimal data necessary to operate features (e.g., balances, tickets, invites).

7. Liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Bot maintainers are not liable for any damages arising from use of the Bot.

8. Contact
- For questions or issues, contact a server administrator or open a ticket using the Bot’s /ticket command.
